This project simulates a real-world information systems development process where requirements may be incomplete, subject to change, and require developer initiative to fill gaps. 
The goal is to create a conference scheduling system where users can:

Browse the schedule of talks
View their own personal schedule
Schedule meetings with other attendees

The project follows Agile development principles with Trello used for product backlog and scrum board, and Plunker/Repl.it for development. 
Python and Vue are used for the implementation, with sample data provided via APIs.
