This project involved developing a client-side web application for a fictional conference provider, Wellington University Events (WUE). 
The application enables conference attendees to:

Browse the schedule of talks.

Select talks they want to attend.

View their personal timetable.

See which other attendees are attending.

Schedule meetings with other attendees based on availability.

The goal was to trial a single conference first and ensure that attendeesâ€™ selected talks and availability were accounted for when scheduling meetings.


System & Technical Requirements:

Architecture: Client-server (client-only development; server is read-only).

Single-Page Application (SPA): Entire app runs from one page load.

Data Management: Uses browser local storage to save user selections and meetings.

Supported Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (mobile-friendly).


Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vue.js

Logic: Python (for client-side functionality within Vue.js framework)

Data Access: HTTP GET requests to provided server endpoints

Agile Development: Functionality delivered incrementally via weekly sprints, with Trello used for product backlog and scrum board.
